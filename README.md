# 📊 Sports Betting Trends Analysis  

## 🏆 Project Overview  
This project explores **trends in Sports Betting lines**, focusing on the **Over/Under, Moneyline, and Spread** across three major leagues:  
- **🏈 NFL (National Football League)**  
- **🏀 NBA (National Basketball Association)**  
- **🎓 CBB (College Basketball Mens)**  

The dataset consists of data from approximately **1,250 games** across these leagues. I independently gathered the data, wrote SQL queries, and built the visualizations to uncover insights. The final product is a **Tableau Story** consisting of **8 dashboards** that provide an interactive look at key betting trends.  

**Disclaimer**: The findings from this project are intended for educational and analytical purposes only. They should **not** be used for actual betting decisions.
