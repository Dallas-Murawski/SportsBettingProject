## ðŸ“Š Tableau Overview

This project includes a Tableau Story consisting of 8 interactive dashboards that analyze trends in sports betting across three major leagues: the NFL, NBA, and Men's College Basketball (CBB). The dashboards provide insights into the **Over/Under**, **Moneyline**, and **Spread** betting trends, offering a deep dive into betting data and its behavior.

### Dashboards Overview:
1. **General Betting Line Success Rates**  
   This dashboard provides an overall summary of trends across all three leagues, showcasing the success rates for a multitude of spread lines and moneylines, as well as the success rates of Over and Under. This dashboard combines the data from all three leagues.

2. **NFL Betting Line Success Rates**  
   This dashboard is similar to the first, except only NFL data was used in the calculations. Similarly to the first dashboard, this one breaks down trends for the Over/Under, Moneyline, and Spread bets.

3. **NBA Betting Line Success Rates**  
   This dashboard again mirrors the first dashboard, with the only difference being that only NBA data was considered.

4. **CBB Betting Line Success Rates**  
   This is the final dashboard that takes the form of the first. As can be expected, this dashboard showcases the same success rates as the prior three and only uses CBB data.
   
5. **Individual Line Success Rates**  
   A general dashboard, like the first, that combines the data from all three leagues. This dashboard provides insights into the performance of each individual line in the data. The Over/Under section groups its lines into two groups, one for lines below -110 and one for lines above -110. This works well, because every game that has a line below -110 will have one above -110 (e.g. the Over is at -112 and the Under is at -108). The spread and moneyline sections show the hit rates for each individual spread line or moneyline that appeared in the data.

6. **Betting Against the Spread**  
   A comparison dashboard that showcases the average point differential of each team that appears in the data. A positive value indicates that the team scores more on average than its opponent, while a negative value indicates the opposite.

7. **Spread Win Rates for Each League**  
   A deeper look at Spread betting, exploring how each league differs in the performance of the favorited team and the underdog. Included are the results of the league data combined.

8. **Miscellaneous Data on Points Scored in a Game**  
   This dashboard showcases miscellaneous data relating to points scored in a game, showcasing that there are many more questions that can be answered by the data.

You can interact with the dashboards to explore specific trends and filter the data based on different betting lines, teams, and more. Explore the data that you find most interesting!
